# WookieController - Firmware #

This system is built around the `ARM-Cortex-M4 STM32F407` and `Chibios`.


## Shell commands ##
- mem - displays memory usage
- threads - all threads on the device

The shell can be accessed via RS232 (UART6) or the SubD-port of the base board.
Also there is a USB serial to connect to the commands.

Source locations are:
```
src\cmd
```
